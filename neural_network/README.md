# Neural Network
This is a neural network written using Numpy and no other library

* neuron.py contains a basic neuron which has predefined weights that calculates an output using an activation function
* modelNeuralNetwork.py is a model of a neural network having an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer
* neuralNetwork.py is the actual model that can be trained using a backpropogation

# Future works to be done
neuralNetwork.py requires a fixed number of inputs because of the limitation of using a hardcoded chain rule for back propogation.
So, implementing an Automatic Differentiation to the program would be cool.
